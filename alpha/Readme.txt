1. Setup & Start-up
-------------------

Unzip all the files in a same folder. After that, run the 'install.bat'
file, which will copy some files in to their correct locations.
If errors occured, try again first and if it still crashes, open the
'install.bat' in e.g. Notepad and do manually the necessary things
mentioned inside.

After succesful installation you are good to go and run the KofF.exe.
If you experience oddities during gameplay, check the 'Settings.ini'
for some options which can increase performance.


2. Gameplay & Controls
----------------------

2.1. Gameplay
Move throuhg the world, enter cities and dungeons, slay monsters, buy
weapons and converse with others.

2.2. Controls
 - Arrows to move
 - Right Shift cycles through 'talk' and 'fight' modes
 - Return enters places
 - Numbers 1-9 open inventory
 - 'H' mounts/dismounts if player owns a horse
 - Space pauses the game

2.3. Conversation / Parser
To engage in a conversation with a person, you must walk "into" him,
while in a 'talk' mode. A console appears in the bottom of the screen,
waiting your input.

The conversation is done in english, with more or less FULL SENTENCES.
In most cases you won't be able to do your bussiness with just one or
two words. This is to ensure that the parser is as versatile as possible
(can understand more complex things than just "buy" or "sell") and to
increase immersion. Remember that there are many different ways of saying
something, for example:

You wish to buy an axe in a shop. You could say for instance:
>>> I wish to buy an axe.
>>> Can I buy an ax?
>>> Is it possible for me to get an axe here?
>>> Sell me an axe, please.
>>> I want an axe.
