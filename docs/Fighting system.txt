How is the outcome of a fight calculated.
'Dice' means a virtual throw of a standard 6-sided dice.

If a dice added with attacers fighting skill is equal or higher than defenders same, the attacker has hit, otherwise the defender has deflected the blow.

To determine if the hit is an injuring one or just a minor scratch, attackers strength is compared to defenders armor (both modified with a dice roll). If the attacker's value is higher (or equal), the blow has found its mark and the defender is injured.

After that, the defender can try to attack the attacker. Whichever loses all of his health first, dies.
